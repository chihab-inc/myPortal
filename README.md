# myPortal
A web portal to manage an unlimited set of web links categorized into multiple sections. This should improve the work flow for users who need to use multiple web services to carry out their job. This is a sort of bookmarking, but much more fluid and much more user friendly. In the future, this product is to become a very helpful dashboard for link-shortcut saving, note saving, analytics.. all based on your own browser without sharing any of your data with anyone. (Source-code is analyzable by anyone at anytime, and anywhere)

## HOW TO RUN THE SERVER?
### YOU HAVE JUST CLONED THE REPO
If you know what 'cloned the repo' is, then you probably know how to run node as a developer, go ahead! Experiment with **myPortal** and come up with new ideas!
Okay, run the server using the good old `node index.js`, or `node.exe index.js` command. (or `nodemon` if you have `nodemon` installed)

### YOU HAVE JUST DOWNLOADED THE RELEASE
You're here, so you have at least downloaded the package, extracted it and gotten inside myPortal.
#### YOU'RE ON LINUX
Execute the file run-linux.sh
#### YOU'RE ON MACOS
Execute the file run-macos.sh
#### YOU'RE ON WINDOWS
Execute the file run-windows.bat

## HOW TO USE?
Once the server is running, open a browser and head to `localhost:3898`. This should bring up the app's page.

# ENJOY!
