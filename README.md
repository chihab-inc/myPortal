# myPortal
A web portal to manage an unlimited set of web links categorized into multiple sections. This should improve the work flow for users who need to use multiple web services to carry out their job. This is a sort of bookmarking, but much more fluid and much more user friendly.

## HOW TO RUN THE SERVER?
Once the repository has been cloned, head to the main node folder. Once in, run the server using the good old `node index.js` or `nodemon`. There is no need to `npm install` any dependecy. The app is pretty lightweight and all the dependecies are in the repository.

## HOW TO USE?
Once the server is running, open a browser and head to `localhost:3898`. This should bring up the app's page.

# ENJOY!
